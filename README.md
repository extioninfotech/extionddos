An Advanced Layer 7 DDoS tool written by Cybersecurity team of Extion infotech
</p>

# Description

**ExtionDdos** is an Offensive Security Tool written in Python3 by Aryan from Extion Infotech for the students enrolled in Extion Cyberpath, designed to perform **Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)** attacks.

### **Focus on Layer 7 Attacks**

The focus of the tool is on **layer 7 attacks**, which are known to be the most advanced types of DDoS attacks. The tool offers the user a choice between three different DDoS attack methods: 

- UDP Flood
- SYN Flood
- HTTP Flood

### **What is DDoS?**

DDoS is an abbreviation for **Distributed Denial of Service**, a type of attack aimed at disrupting the availability of a targeted website, network, or service. This attack is typically carried out by overwhelming the target with a large amount of traffic from multiple sources. In the context of red teaming and pentesting, DDoS attacks are simulated to evaluate the ability of the blue team to withstand such sophisticated attacks.

### **Optimized for Speed and Efficiency**

"ExtionDdos" is optimized for speed and efficiency, making it a great choice for those looking to execute DDoS attacks in a timely and effective manner. The tool provides real-time feedback on the number of packets sent during the attack, enabling the user to monitor its progress.

### **User-Friendly and Easy to Use**

Moreover, the tool is designed with ease of use in mind, allowing even novice users to carry out advanced DDoS attacks with ease.


# New Features in Version: 2.0

• Focus on Layer 7 attacks: The tool is re-designed to specifically target the most sophisticated types of DDoS attacks, known as layer 7 attacks.

• Multiple attack types: The tool offers three different types of DDoS attacks: UDP Flood, SYN Flood, and HTTP Flood, giving the user flexibility in their choice of attack.

• Optimized for speed: ExtionDdos is designed to perform attacks quickly and efficiently, making it an ideal choice for those looking to disrupt the target as quickly as possible.

• Real-time feedback: The tool provides real-time feedback on the number of packets sent during the attack, allowing the user to monitor the progress of the attack.
